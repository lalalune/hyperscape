## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts (3000/3000 in use)**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
npm start
```

**Tests failing with connection errors**:
```bash
pkill -f "hyperfy"  # Kill any existing Hyperfy processes
npm test
```

**Build errors after updates**:
```bash
rm -rf packages/*/build packages/*/dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Character data reset**:
```bash
# Remove world database to reset all player progress
rm packages/rpg/rpg-world/db.sqlite
npm start
```

### Performance Tips

- **Lower graphics**: Use "Performance" mode in browser settings
- **Close other tabs**: Reduces memory usage for better framerate  
- **Restart server**: If world becomes laggy, restart with `npm start`
- **Clear browser cache**: May help with asset loading issues

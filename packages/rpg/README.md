## 🏗️ Architecture

### Real Hyperfy Integration

This RPG system uses the **actual Hyperfy framework** from `packages/hyperfy`:

- **RPGPlayer.hyp** - Complete player character with stats, inventory, and combat
- **RPGGoblin.hyp** - AI-driven goblin mobs with combat and loot drops
- **Real Hyperfy APIs** - Uses `app.create()`, `app.configure()`, `world.chat.send()`, etc.
